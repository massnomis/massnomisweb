# massnomisweb
guess i got a ui then


# what is this?
my goal is to create a no-code dashboard builder web app, in js and python. 
Utilizing past queries from flipside, and open source API's like Debank, Zapper, AAVE, and defilama ect,
users should be a able to use already done queries, and create charts based on these, as well as add some comentary and some spice.


# right now,
working on merging branches and bringing in better documentation.
